@ARTICLE{Felsenstein1974-hl,
  title    = "The evolutionary advantage of recombination",
  author   = "Felsenstein, J",
  abstract = "The controversy over the evolutionary advantage of recombination
              initially discovered by Fisher and by Muller is reviewed. Those
              authors whose models had finite-population effects found an
              advantage of recombination, and those whose models had infinite
              populations found none. The advantage of recombination is that it
              breaks down random linkage disequilibrium generated by genetic
              drift. Hill and Robertson found that the average effect of this
              randomly-generated linkage disequilibrium was to cause linked
              loci to interfere with each other's response to selection, even
              where there was no gene interaction between the loci. This effect
              is shown to be identical to the original argument of Fisher and
              Muller. It also predicts the ``ratchet mechanism'' discovered by
              Muller, who pointed out that deleterious mutants would more
              readily increase in a population without recombination. Computer
              simulations of substitution of favorable mutants and of the
              long-term increase of deleterious mutants verified the essential
              correctness of the original Fisher-Muller argument and the
              reality of the Muller ratchet mechanism. It is argued that these
              constitute an intrinsic advantage of recombination capable of
              accounting for its persistence in the face of selection for
              tighter linkage between interacting polymorphisms, and possibly
              capable of accounting for its origin.",

  abstract = "The genetic component of complex disease risk in humans remains
              largely unexplained. A corollary is that the allelic spectrum of
              genetic variants contributing to complex disease risk is unknown.
              Theoretical models that relate population genetic processes to
              the maintenance of genetic variation for quantitative traits may
              suggest profitable avenues for future experimental design. Here
              we use forward simulation to model a genomic region evolving
              under a balance between recurrent deleterious mutation and
              Gaussian stabilizing selection. We consider multiple genetic and
              demographic models, and several different methods for identifying
              genomic regions harboring variants associated with complex
              disease risk. We demonstrate that the model of gene action,
              relating genotype to phenotype, has a qualitative effect on
              several relevant aspects of the population genetic architecture
              of a complex trait. In particular, the genetic model impacts
              genetic variance component partitioning across the allele
              frequency spectrum and the power of statistical tests. Models
              with partial recessivity closely match the minor allele frequency
              distribution of significant hits from empirical genome-wide
              association studies without requiring homozygous effect sizes to
              be small. We highlight a particular gene-based model of
              incomplete recessivity that is appealing from first principles.
              Under that model, deleterious mutations in a genomic region
              partially fail to complement one another. This model of
              gene-based recessivity predicts the empirically observed
              inconsistency between twin and SNP based estimated of dominance
              heritability. Furthermore, this model predicts considerable
              levels of unexplained variance associated with intralocus
              epistasis. Our results suggest a need for improved statistical
              tools for region based genetic association and heritability

  abstract  = "A population can adapt to a rapid environmental change or
               habitat expansion in two ways. It may adapt either through new
               beneficial mutations that subsequently sweep through the
               population or by using alleles from the standing genetic
               variation. We use diffusion theory to calculate the
               probabilities for selective adaptations and find a large
               increase in the fixation probability for weak substitutions, if
               alleles originate from the standing genetic variation. We then
               determine the parameter regions where each scenario---standing

               contribute to a substitution, and discuss the consequences for
               the footprint of selection on linked neutral variation. We find

  abstract = "The process of strong artificial selection during a domestication
              event is modeled, and its effect on the pattern of DNA
              polymorphism is investigated. The model also considers population
              bottleneck during domestication. Artificial selection during
              domestication is different from a regular selective sweep because
              artificial selection acts on alleles that may have been neutral
              variants before domestication. Therefore, the fixation of such a
              beneficial allele does not always wipe out DNA variation in the
              surrounding region. The amount by which variation is reduced
              largely depends on the initial frequency of the beneficial
              allele, p. As a consequence, p has a strong effect on the
              likelihood of detecting the signature of selection during
              domestication from patterns of polymorphism. These theoretical
              results are discussed in light of data collected from maize.

  abstract = "Abstract We derived analytical results for the reduction of the
              level of neutral polymorphism due to genetic hitchhiking using
              diffusion theory. In the case of a single strongly selected
              substitution, expected heterozygosity at a linked neutral locus
              is reduced by a factor (2cs)$\alpha$−2cs$\Gamma$(−2cs),
              1$\alpha$), where s is the selective advantage of the favored
              allele, c is the recombination fraction between the neutral and
              selected locus, and $\alpha$ = 2Ns, with N as the diploid
              population size. $\Gamma$ denotes the incomplete gamma function.
              Using this result and assuming that at any one time at most one
              substitution is on its way to fixation, the effect of recurrent
              selected substitutions on expected heterozygosity can be

              adaptation to distant trait optima",
  author   = "Stetter, Markus G and Thornton, Kevin and Ross-Ibarra, Jeffrey",
  abstract = "Understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic adaptation to
              changing environments is an essential goal of population and
              quantitative genetics. While technological advances now allow
              interrogation of genome-wide genotyping data in large panels, our
              theoretical understanding of the process of polygenic adaptation
              is still quite limited. To address this limitation, we use
              extensive forward-time simulation to explore the impacts of
              variation in demography, trait genetics, and selection on the
              rate and mode of adaptation and the resulting genetic
              architecture. We simulate a population adapting to an optimum
              shift, modeling sequence variation for 20 QTL for each of 12
              different demographies for 100 different traits varying in the
              effect size distribution of new mutations, the strength of
              stabilizing selection, and the contribution of the genomic
              background. We then use random forest regression approaches to
              learn the relative importance of input parameters for statistics
              of interest such as the speed of adaptation, the relative
              frequency of hard sweeps and sweeps from standing variation, or
              the final genetic architecture of the trait. We find that
              selective sweeps occur even for traits under relatively weak
              selection and where the genetic background explains most of the
              variation. Though most sweeps occur from variation segregating in
              the ancestral population, new mutations can be important for
              traits under strong stabilizing selection that undergo a large
              optimum shift. Additionally, we find that deleterious mutations
              are more strongly influenced by the strength of stabilizing
              selection. We also show that population bottlenecks and expansion
              impact overall genetic variation as well as the relative
              importance of sweeps from standing variation and the speed with
              which adaptation can occur. We then use the matrix of effect
              sizes and allele frequencies in each population as a target for
              machine learning and find that demography and the effect size of
              new mutations have the largest influence on present day genetic
              architecture. Because a variety of parameter combinations can
              result in relatively similar genetic architectures, we conclude
              that it is not straightforward to infer much about the process of
              adaptation from the genetic architecture alone. Overall, our
              results underscore the complex population genetics of individual
              loci in even relatively simple quantitative trait models but
              provide a glimpse into the factors that drive this complexity.",

               individual-based population genetics simulations with arbitrary
               breeding models, population structure and demography. This
               approach dramatically reduces the computational burden of
               tracking individual genomes by allowing us to simulate only
               those loci that may affect reproduction (those having
               non-neutral variants). The genetic history of the population is
               recorded as a succinct tree sequence as introduced in the
               software package msprime, on which neutral mutations can be
               quickly placed afterwards. Recording the results of each
               breeding event requires storage that grows linearly with time,
               but there is a great deal of redundancy in this information. We
               solve this storage problem by providing an algorithm to quickly
               'simplify' a tree sequence by removing this irrelevant history
               for a given set of genomes. By periodically simplifying the
               history with respect to the extant population, we show that the
               total storage space required is modest and overall large
               efficiency gains can be made over classical forward-time
               simulations. We implement a general-purpose framework for
               recording and simplifying genealogical data, which can be used
               to make simulations of any population model more efficient. We
               modify two popular forwards-time simulation frameworks to use
               this new approach and observe efficiency gains in large,
               whole-genome simulations of one to two orders of magnitude. In
               addition to speed, our method for recording pedigrees has
               several advantages: (1) All marginal genealogies of the
               simulated individuals are recorded, rather than just genotypes.
               (2) A population of N individuals with M polymorphic sites can
               be stored in O(N log N + M) space, making it feasible to store a
               simulation's entire final generation as well as its history. (3)
               A simulation can easily be initialized with a more efficient
               coalescent simulation of deep history. The software for

  abstract = "Since the initial description of the genomic patterns expected
              under models of positive selection acting on standing genetic
              variation and on multiple beneficial mutations - so-called soft
              selective sweeps - researchers have sought to identify these
              patterns in natural population data. Indeed, over the past two
              years, large-scale data analyses have argued that soft sweeps are
              pervasive across organisms of very different effective population
              size and mutation rate - humans, Drosophila, and HIV. Yet, others
              have evaluated the relevance of these models to natural
              populations, as well as the identifiability of the models
              relative to other known population-level processes, arguing that
              soft sweeps are likely to be rare. Here, we look to reconcile
              these opposing results by carefully evaluating three recent
              studies and their underlying methodologies. Using population
              genetic theory, as well as extensive simulation, we find that all
              three examples are prone to extremely high false-positive rates,
              incorrectly identifying soft sweeps under both hard sweep and
              neutral models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that well-fit
              demographic histories combined with rare hard sweeps serve as the
              more parsimonious explanation. These findings represent a
              necessary response to the growing tendency of invoking
              parameter-heavy, assumption-laden models of pervasive positive
              selection, and neglecting best practices regarding the

  title    = "Polygenic adaptation: From sweeps to subtle frequency shifts",
  author   = "H{\"o}llinger, Ilse and Pennings, Pleuni S and Hermisson, Joachim",
  abstract = "Evolutionary theory has produced two conflicting paradigms for
              the adaptation of a polygenic trait. While population genetics
              views adaptation as a sequence of selective sweeps at single loci
              underlying the trait, quantitative genetics posits a collective
              response, where phenotypic adaptation results from subtle allele
              frequency shifts at many loci. Yet, a synthesis of these views is
              largely missing and the population genetic factors that favor
              each scenario are not well understood. Here, we study the
              architecture of adaptation of a binary polygenic trait (such as
              resistance) with negative epistasis among the loci of its basis.
              The genetic structure of this trait allows for a full range of
              potential architectures of adaptation, ranging from sweeps to
              small frequency shifts. By combining computer simulations and a
              newly devised analytical framework based on Yule branching
              processes, we gain a detailed understanding of the adaptation
              dynamics for this trait. Our key analytical result is an
              expression for the joint distribution of mutant alleles at the
              end of the adaptive phase. This distribution characterizes the
              polygenic pattern of adaptation at the underlying genotype when
              phenotypic adaptation has been accomplished. We find that a
              single compound parameter, the population-scaled background
              mutation rate $\Theta$bg, explains the main differences among
              these patterns. For a focal locus, $\Theta$bg measures the
              mutation rate at all redundant loci in its genetic background
              that offer alternative ways for adaptation. For adaptation
              starting from mutation-selection-drift balance, we observe
              different patterns in three parameter regions. Adaptation
              proceeds by sweeps for small $\Theta$bg ≲ 0.1, while small
              polygenic allele frequency shifts require large $\Theta$bg ≳ 100.
              In the large intermediate regime, we observe a heterogeneous
              pattern of partial sweeps at several interacting loci.",

              populations, with individuals in the northwest being taller, on
              average, than those in the southeast. During the past six years,
              a series of papers reported that polygenic scores for height also
              show a north to south gradient, and that this cline results from
              natural selection. These polygenic analyses relied on external
              estimates of SNP effects on height, taken from the GIANT
              consortium and from smaller replication studies. Here, we
              describe a new analysis based on SNP effect estimates from a
              large independent data set, the UK Biobank (UKB). We find that
              the signals of selection using UKB effect-size estimates for
              height are strongly attenuated, though not entirely absent.
              Because multiple prior lines of evidence provided independent
              support for directional selection on height, there is no single
              simple explanation for all the discrepancies. Nonetheless, our
              current view is that previous analyses were likely confounded by
              population stratification and so the conclusion of strong
              polygenic adaptation in Europe now lacks clear support. Moreover,
              these discrepancies highlight (1) that current methods for
              correcting for population structure in GWAS may not always be
              sufficient for polygenic trait analyses, and (2) that claims of
              polygenic differences between populations should be treated with
              caution until these issues are better understood.",

               individually rare hidden structural variants (SVs) could account
               for a significant fraction of variation in complex traits. To
               investigate this hypothesis, we assembled 14 Drosophila
               melanogaster genomes and systematically identified more than
               20,000 euchromatic SVs, of which ~40\% are invisible to high
               specificity short read genotyping approaches. SVs are common in
               Drosophila genes, with almost one third of diploid individuals
               harboring an SV in genes larger than 5kb, and nearly a quarter
               harboring multiple SVs in genes larger than 10kb. We show that
               SV alleles are rarer than amino acid polymorphisms, implying
               that they are more strongly deleterious. A number of
               functionally important genes harbor previously hidden structural

               Drsl5, Cyp28d1\&2, InR, and Gss1\&2). Furthermore, SVs are

               eight Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR) mapping

  abstract = "Purifying selection reduces genetic diversity, both at sites
              under direct selection and at linked neutral sites. This process,
              known as background selection, is thought to play an important
              role in shaping genomic diversity in natural populations. Yet
              despite its importance, the effects of background selection are
              not fully understood. Previous theoretical analyses of this
              process have taken a backward-time approach based on the
              structured coalescent. While they provide some insight, these
              methods are either limited to very small samples or are
              computationally prohibitive. Here, we present a new forward-time
              analysis of the trajectories of both neutral and deleterious
              mutations at a nonrecombining locus. We find that strong
              purifying selection leads to remarkably rich dynamics: neutral
              mutations can exhibit sweep-like behavior, and deleterious
              mutations can reach substantial frequencies even when they are
              guaranteed to eventually go extinct. Our analysis of these
              dynamics allows us to calculate analytical expressions for the
              full site frequency spectrum. We find that whenever background
              selection is strong enough to lead to a reduction in genetic
              diversity, it also results in substantial distortions to the site
              frequency spectrum, which can mimic the effects of population
              expansions or positive selection. Because these distortions are
              most pronounced in the low and high frequency ends of the
              spectrum, they become particularly important in larger samples,
              but may have small effects in smaller samples. We also apply our
              forward-time framework to calculate other quantities, such as the
              ultimate fates of polymorphisms or the fitnesses of their
              ancestral backgrounds.",

              departures from expectations under the standard neutral model. We

              and Zimbabwe) and West/Central sub-Saharan (Gabon) African
              populations. A skew toward high-frequency-derived polymorphisms,

              heterogeneity in levels of polymorphism and divergence in the

              selection. Evidence for selective sweeps is also found in many
              other regions, including genes known to be associated with

  title    = "Commentary: Fisher's infinitesimal model: A story for the ages",
  author   = "Turelli, Michael",
  abstract = "Mendel (1866) suggested that if many heritable ``factors''
              contribute to a trait, near-continuous variation could result.
              Fisher (1918) clarified the connection between Mendelian
              inheritance and continuous trait variation by assuming many loci,
              each with small effect, and by informally invoking the central
              limit theorem. Barton et al. (2017) rigorously analyze the
              approach to a multivariate Gaussian distribution of the genetic
              effects for descendants of parents who may be related. This
              commentary distinguishes three nested approximations, referred to
              as ``infinitesimal genetics,'' ``Gaussian descendants'' and
              ``Gaussian population,'' each plausibly called ``the
              infinitesimal model.'' The first and most basic is Fisher's
              ``infinitesimal'' approximation of the underlying genetics -
              namely, many loci, each making a small contribution to the total
              variance. As Barton et al. (2017) show, in the limit as the
              number of loci increases (with enough additivity), the
              distribution of genotypic values for descendants approaches a
              multivariate Gaussian, whose variance-covariance structure
              depends only on the relatedness, not the phenotypes, of the
              parents (or whether their population experiences selection or
              other processes such as mutation and migration). Barton et al.
              (2017) call this rigorously defensible ``Gaussian descendants''
              approximation ``the infinitesimal model.'' However, it is widely
              assumed that Fisher's genetic assumptions yield another Gaussian
              approximation, in which the distribution of breeding values in a
              population follows a Gaussian - even if the population is subject
              to non-Gaussian selection. This third ``Gaussian population''
              approximation, is also described as the ``infinitesimal model.''
              Unlike the ``Gaussian descendants'' approximation, this third
              approximation cannot be rigorously justified, except in a
              weak-selection limit, even for a purely additive model.
              Nevertheless, it underlies the two most widely used descriptions
              of selection-induced changes in trait means and genetic
              variances, the ``breeder's equation'' and the ``Bulmer effect.''
              Future generations may understand why the ``infinitesimal model''
              provides such useful approximations in the face of epistasis,
              linkage, linkage disequilibrium and strong selection.",

  author   = "Berg, Jeremy J and Coop, Graham",
  abstract = "The use of genetic polymorphism data to understand the dynamics
              of adaptation and identify the loci that are involved has become
              a major pursuit of modern evolutionary genetics. In addition to
              the classical ``hard sweep'' hitchhiking model, recent research
              has drawn attention to the fact that the dynamics of adaptation
              can play out in a variety of different ways and that the specific
              signatures left behind in population genetic data may depend
              somewhat strongly on these dynamics. One particular model for
              which a large number of empirical examples are already known is
              that in which a single derived mutation arises and drifts to some
              low frequency before an environmental change causes the allele to
              become beneficial and sweeps to fixation. Here, we pursue an
              analytical investigation of this model, bolstered and extended
              via simulation study. We use coalescent theory to develop an
              analytical approximation for the effect of a sweep from standing
              variation on the genealogy at the locus of the selected allele
              and sites tightly linked to it. We show that the distribution of
              haplotypes that the selected allele is present on at the time of
              the environmental change can be approximated by considering
              recombinant haplotypes as alleles in the infinite-alleles model.
              We show that this approximation can be leveraged to make accurate
              predictions regarding patterns of genetic polymorphism following
              such a sweep. We then use simulations to highlight which sources
              of haplotypic information are likely to be most useful in
              distinguishing this model from neutrality, as well as from other
              sweep models, such as the classic hard sweep and
              multiple-mutation soft sweeps. We find that in general,
              adaptation from a unique standing variant will likely be
              difficult to detect on the basis of genetic polymorphism data
              from a single population time point alone, and when it can be
              detected, it will be difficult to distinguish from other
              varieties of selective sweeps. Samples from multiple populations
              and/or time points have the potential to ease this difficulty.",

  abstract = "Characterizing the nature of the adaptive process at the genetic
              level is a central goal for population genetics. In particular,
              we know little about the sources of adaptive substitution or
              about the number of adaptive variants currently segregating in
              nature. Historically, population geneticists have focused
              attention on the hard-sweep model of adaptation in which a de
              novo beneficial mutation arises and rapidly fixes in a
              population. Recently more attention has been given to soft-sweep
              models, in which alleles that were previously neutral, or nearly
              so, drift until such a time as the environment shifts and their
              selection coefficient changes to become beneficial. It remains an
              active and difficult problem, however, to tease apart the
              telltale signatures of hard vs. soft sweeps in genomic
              polymorphism data. Through extensive simulations of hard- and
              soft-sweep models, here we show that indeed the two might not be
              separable through the use of simple summary statistics. In
              particular, it seems that recombination in regions linked to, but
              distant from, sites of hard sweeps can create patterns of
              polymorphism that closely mirror what is expected to be found
              near soft sweeps. We find that a very similar situation arises
              when using haplotype-based statistics that are aimed at detecting
              partial or ongoing selective sweeps, such that it is difficult to
              distinguish the shoulder of a hard sweep from the center of a
              partial sweep. While knowing the location of the selected site
              mitigates this problem slightly, we show that stochasticity in
              signatures of natural selection will frequently cause the signal
              to reach its zenith far from this site and that this effect is
              more severe for soft sweeps; thus inferences of the target as
              well as the mode of positive selection may be inaccurate. In
              addition, both the time since a sweep ends and biologically
              realistic levels of allelic gene conversion lead to errors in the
              classification and identification of selective sweeps. This
              general problem of ``soft shoulders'' underscores the difficulty
              in differentiating soft and partial sweeps from hard-sweep
              scenarios in molecular population genomics data. The
              soft-shoulder effect also implies that the more common hard
              sweeps have been in recent evolutionary history, the more
              prevalent spurious signatures of soft or partial sweeps may
              appear in some genome-wide scans.",

  abstract = "Human genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are revealing the
              genetic architecture of anthropomorphic and biomedical traits,
              i.e., the frequencies and effect sizes of variants that
              contribute to heritable variation in a trait. To interpret these
              findings, we need to understand how genetic architecture is
              shaped by basic population genetics processes-notably, by
              mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. Because many
              quantitative traits are subject to stabilizing selection and
              because genetic variation that affects one trait often affects
              many others, we model the genetic architecture of a focal trait
              that arises under stabilizing selection in a multidimensional
              trait space. We solve the model for the phenotypic distribution
              and allelic dynamics at steady state and derive robust,
              closed-form solutions for summary statistics of the genetic
              architecture. Our results provide a simple interpretation for
              missing heritability and why it varies among traits. They predict
              that the distribution of variances contributed by loci identified
              in GWASs is well approximated by a simple functional form that
              depends on a single parameter: the expected contribution to
              genetic variance of a strongly selected site affecting the trait.
              We test this prediction against the results of GWASs for height
              and body mass index (BMI) and find that it fits the data well,
              allowing us to make inferences about the degree of pleiotropy and
              mutational target size for these traits. Our findings help to
              explain why the GWAS for height explains more of the heritable
              variance than the similarly sized GWAS for BMI and to predict the
              increase in explained heritability with study sample size.
              Considering the demographic history of European populations, in
              which these GWASs were performed, we further find that most of
              the associations they identified likely involve mutations that
              arose shortly before or during the Out-of-Africa bottleneck at
              sites with selection coefficients around s = 10-3.",

               loci can be detected by examining the single nucleotide
               polymorphism patterns in intraspecific genome alignments. In the
               last decade, a plethora of algorithms for identifying selective
               sweeps have been developed. However, the majority of these
               algorithms have not been designed for analyzing whole-genome
               data. We present SweeD (Sweep Detector), an open-source tool for
               the rapid detection of selective sweeps in whole genomes. It
               analyzes site frequency spectra and represents a substantial
               extension of the widely used SweepFinder program. The sequential
               version of SweeD is up to 22 times faster than SweepFinder and,

               using SweeD leads to more accurate sweep detection. We validate
               SweeD via simulations and by scanning the first chromosome from
               the 1000 human Genomes project for selective sweeps. We compare

  abstract  = "Author Summary The genetic basis of recent adaptation can be
               uncovered from genomic patterns of variation, which are
               perturbed in predictable ways when a beneficial mutation
               ``sweeps'' through a population. However, the detection of such
               ``selective sweeps'' is complicated by demographic events, such
               as population expansion, which can produce similar skews in
               genetic diversity. Here, we present a method for detecting
               selective sweeps that is remarkably powerful and robust to
               potentially confounding demographic histories. This method,
               called S/HIC, operates using a machine learning paradigm to
               combine many different features of population genetic variation,
               and examine their values across a large genomic region in order
               to infer whether a selective sweep has recently occurred near
               its center. S/HIC is also able to accurately distinguish between
               selection acting on de novo beneficial mutations (``hard
               sweeps'') and selection on previously standing variants (``soft
               sweeps''). We demonstrate S/HIC's power on a variety of

  abstract = "Considerable interest is focused on the use of polymorphism data
              to identify regions of the genome that underlie recent
              adaptations. These searches are guided by a simple model of
              positive selection, in which a mutation is favored as soon as it
              arises. This assumption may not be realistic, as environmental
              changes and range expansions may lead previously neutral or
              deleterious alleles to become beneficial. We examine what effect
              this mode of selection has on patterns of variation at linked
              neutral sites by implementing a new coalescent model of positive
              directional selection on standing variation. In this model, a
              neutral allele arises and drifts in the population, then at
              frequency f becomes beneficial, and eventually reaches fixation.
              Depending on the value of f, this scenario can lead to a large
              variance in allele frequency spectra and in levels of linkage
              disequilibrium at linked, neutral sites. In particular, for
              intermediate f, the beneficial substitution often leads to a loss
              of rare alleles--a pattern that differs markedly from the
              signature of directional selection currently relied on by

              by statistical methods that assume a Gaussian (normal)
              distribution of breeding values. We present an alternative
              analysis based on multilocus population genetics. We use a
              general representation of selection, recombination, and drift to
              analyze an idealized polygenic system in which all genetic
              effects are additive (i.e., both dominance and epistasis are
              absent), but no assumptions are made about the distribution of
              breeding values or the numbers of loci or alleles. Our analysis
              produces three results. First, our equations reproduce the
              standard recursions for the mean and additive variance if
              breeding values are Gaussian; but they also reveal how
              non-Gaussian distributions of breeding values will alter these
              dynamics. Second, an approximation valid for weak selection shows
              that even if genetic variance is attributable to an effectively
              infinite number of loci with only additive effects, selection
              will generally drive the distribution of breeding values away
              from a Gaussian distribution by creating multilocus linkage
              disequilibria. Long-term dynamics of means can depart
              substantially from the predictions of the standard selection
              recursions, but the discrepancy may often be negligible for
              short-term selection. Third, by including mutation, we show that,
              for realistic parameter values, linkage disequilibrium has little
              effect on the amount of additive variance maintained at an
              equilibrium between stabilizing selection and mutation. Each of

              evolution via small changes in the allele frequencies at many
              loci. While the first process has been thoroughly investigated

  abstract = "The genetic architecture of adaptation in natural populations has
              not yet been resolved: it is not clear to what extent the spread
              of beneficial mutations (selective sweeps) or the response of
              many quantitative trait loci drive adaptation to environmental
              changes. Although much attention has been given to the genomic
              footprint of selective sweeps, the importance of selection on
              quantitative traits is still not well studied, as the associated
              genomic signature is extremely difficult to detect. We propose
              'Evolve and Resequence' as a promising tool, to study polygenic
              adaptation of quantitative traits in evolving populations.
              Simulating replicated time series data we show that adaptation to
              a new intermediate trait optimum has three characteristic phases
              that are reflected on the genomic level: (1) directional
              frequency changes towards the new trait optimum, (2) plateauing
              of allele frequencies when the new trait optimum has been reached
              and (3) subsequent divergence between replicated trajectories
              ultimately leading to the loss or fixation of alleles while the
              trait value does not change. We explore these 3 phase
              characteristics for relevant population genetic parameters to
              provide expectations for various experimental evolution designs.
              Remarkably, over a broad range of parameters the trajectories of
              selected alleles display a pattern across replicates, which
              differs both from neutrality and directional selection. We
              conclude that replicated time series data from experimental
              evolution studies provide a promising framework to study
              polygenic adaptation from whole-genome population genetics data.",

              interpreted as support for the simple model of genetic
              hitchhiking, in which directional selection on rare variants,
              e.g., newly arising advantageous mutants, sweeps linked neutral
              alleles to fixation, thus eliminating polymorphisms near the
              selected site. However, the frequency spectra of segregating
              sites of several loci from some populations exhibiting reduced
              levels of nucleotide diversity and reduced numbers of segregating
              sites did not appear different from what would be expected under
              a neutral equilibrium model. Specifically, a skew toward an
              excess of rare sites was not observed in these samples, as
              measured by Tajima's D. Because this skew was predicted by a
              simple hitchhiking model, yet it had never been expressed
              quantitatively and compared directly to DNA polymorphism data,
              this paper investigates the hitchhiking effect on the site
              frequency spectrum, as measured by Tajima's D and several other
              statistics, using a computer simulation model based on the
              coalescent process and recurrent hitchhiking events. The results
              presented here demonstrate that under the simple hitchhiking
              model (1) the expected value of Tajima's D is large and negative
              (indicating a skew toward rare variants), (2) that Tajima's test
              has reasonable power to detect a skew in the frequency spectrum
              for parameters comparable to those from actual data sets, and (3)
              that the Tajima's Ds observed in several data sets are very
              unlikely to have been the result of simple hitchhiking.
              Consequently, the simple hitchhiking model is not a sufficient
              explanation for the DNA polymorphism at those loci exhibiting a
              decreased number of segregating sites yet not exhibiting a skew

              forces that influence the pattern of polymorphism in population

              positive selection and negative (background) selection exhibit
              different effects. We propose a new estimator of theta (the
              product of effective population size and neutral mutation rate),
              thetaL, which is sensitive to the changes in high-frequency
              variants. The new thetaL allows us to revise Fay and Wu's H-test
              by normalization. To complement the existing statistics (the
              H-test and Tajima's D-test), we propose a new test, E, which
              relies on the difference between thetaL and Watterson's thetaW.
              We show that this test is most powerful in detecting the recovery
              phase after the loss of genetic diversity, which includes the

              (or robustness against) background selection and demographic

              be most effective in detecting positive selection while being
              insensitive to other perturbations. We thus propose a joint test,
              referred to as the DH test. Simulations indicate that DH is

              distinct models with n additive polygenic loci subject to
              mutation and stabilizing selection. Each is reviewed and a new
              analysis and model are presented. Lande and Fleming analyzed
              extensions of a model originally treated by Kimura which assumes
              a continuum of possible allelic effects at each locus. Latter and
              Bulmer analyzed a model with diallelic loci. The published

              sequential fixation of beneficial mutations. In diploids, this
              picture presupposes that for most adaptive mutations, the
              homozygotes have a higher fitness than the heterozygotes. Here,
              we show that contrary to this expectation, a substantial
              proportion of adaptive mutations should display heterozygote
              advantage. This feature of adaptation in diploids emerges
              naturally from the primary importance of the fitness of
              heterozygotes for the invasion of new adaptive mutations. We
              formalize this result in the framework of Fisher's influential
              geometric model of adaptation. We find that in diploids,
              adaptation should often proceed through a succession of
              short-lived balanced states that maintain substantially higher
              levels of phenotypic and fitness variation in the population
              compared with classic adaptive walks. In fast-changing
              environments, this variation produces a diversity advantage that
              allows diploids to remain better adapted compared with haploids
              despite the disadvantage associated with the presence of unfit
              homozygotes. The short-lived balanced states arising during
              adaptive walks should be mostly invisible to current scans for
              long-term balancing selection. Instead, they should leave
              signatures of incomplete selective sweeps, which do appear to be
              common in many species. Our results also raise the possibility
              that balancing selection, as a natural consequence of frequent
              adaptation, might play a more prominent role among the forces
              maintaining genetic variation than is commonly recognized.",

              heritabilities of quantitative traits and the variance accounted
              for by mapped causative variants. One major potential explanation
              for the missing heritability is allelic heterogeneity, in which
              there are multiple causative variants at each causative gene with
              only a fraction having been identified. The majority of
              genome-wide association studies (GWAS) implicitly assume that a
              single SNP can explain all the variance for a causative locus.
              However, if allelic heterogeneity is prevalent, a substantial
              amount of genetic variance will remain unexplained. In this
              paper, we take a haplotype-based mapping approach and quantify
              the number of alleles segregating at each locus using a large set
              of 7922 eQTL contributing to regulatory variation in the

              also provides a direct test of the allelic heterogeneity
              hypothesis. We find that 95\% of cis-eQTLs and 78\% of
              trans-eQTLs are due to multiple alleles, demonstrating that
              allelic heterogeneity is widespread in Drosophila eQTL. Allelic

              We propose an approximate Bayesian (ABC) polymorphism-based

              signals of very recent positive selection in favor of variants
              that have not yet reached fixation. We describe a new analytical
              method for scanning single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for
              signals of recent selection, and apply this to data from the
              International HapMap Project. In all three continental groups we
              find widespread signals of recent positive selection. Most
              signals are region-specific, though a significant excess are
              shared across groups. Contrary to some earlier low resolution
              studies that suggested a paucity of recent selection in

              loci that are the source of significant phenotypic variation.
              Though the relevant phenotypes are generally not known, such loci

  author   = "Coop, Graham and Ralph, Peter",
  abstract = "Two major sources of stochasticity in the dynamics of neutral
              alleles result from resampling of finite populations (genetic
              drift) and the random genetic background of nearby selected
              alleles on which the neutral alleles are found (linked
              selection). There is now good evidence that linked selection
              plays an important role in shaping polymorphism levels in a
              number of species. One of the best-investigated models of linked
              selection is the recurrent full-sweep model, in which newly
              arisen selected alleles fix rapidly. However, the bulk of
              selected alleles that sweep into the population may not be
              destined for rapid fixation. Here we develop a general model of
              recurrent selective sweeps in a coalescent framework, one that
              generalizes the recurrent full-sweep model to the case where
              selected alleles do not sweep to fixation. We show that in a
              large population, only the initial rapid increase of a selected
              allele affects the genealogy at partially linked sites, which
              under fairly general assumptions are unaffected by the subsequent
              fate of the selected allele. We also apply the theory to a simple
              model to investigate the impact of recurrent partial sweeps on
              levels of neutral diversity and find that for a given reduction
              in diversity, the impact of recurrent partial sweeps on the
              frequency spectrum at neutral sites is determined primarily by
              the frequencies rapidly achieved by the selected alleles.
              Consequently, recurrent sweeps of selected alleles to low
              frequencies can have a profound effect on levels of diversity but
              can leave the frequency spectrum relatively unperturbed. In fact,
              the limiting coalescent model under a high rate of sweeps to low
              frequency is identical to the standard neutral model. The general
              model of selective sweeps we describe goes some way toward
              providing a more flexible framework to describe genomic patterns
              of diversity than is currently available.",

              regions of the genome with genealogies similar to those expected

              observations: abundant polygenic variation and strong stabilizing
              selection that should rapidly deplete that variation. This
              conflict, although having attracted much theoretical attention,
              still stands open. Two classes of model have been proposed: real
              stabilizing selection directly on the metric trait under study
              and apparent stabilizing selection caused solely by the
              deleterious pleiotropic side effects of mutations on fitness.
              Here these models are combined and the total stabilizing
              selection observed is assumed to derive simultaneously through
              these two different mechanisms. Mutations have effects on a
              metric trait and on fitness, and both effects vary continuously.
              The genetic variance (V(G)) and the observed strength of total
              stabilizing selection (V(s,t)) are analyzed with a rare-alleles
              model. Both kinds of selection reduce V(G) but their roles in
              depleting it are not independent: The magnitude of pleiotropic
              selection depends on real stabilizing selection and such
              dependence is subject to the shape of the distributions of
              mutational effects. The genetic variation maintained thus depends
              on the kurtosis as well as the variance of mutational effects:
              All else being equal, V(G) increases with increasing
              leptokurtosis of mutational effects on fitness, while for a given
              distribution of mutational effects on fitness, V(G) decreases
              with increasing leptokurtosis of mutational effects on the trait.
              The V(G) and V(s,t) are determined primarily by real stabilizing
              selection while pleiotropic effects, which can be large, have
              only a limited impact. This finding provides some promise that a
              high heritability can be explained under strong total stabilizing
              selection for what are regarded as typical values of mutation and
              selection parameters.",

              We further show that adaptive evolution is invariably slower at
              X-linked than autosomal loci when evolution begins from
              mutation-selection balance. This result differs from that
              obtained when adaptation uses new mutations, a finding that may
              have some bearing on recent attempts to distinguish between
              hitchhiking and background selection by contrasting the molecular
              population genetics of X-linked vs. autosomal loci. Last, we
              suggest a test to determine whether adaptation used new mutations
              or previously deleterious alleles from the standing genetic
              variation.",

  abstract = "Positive selection can be inferred from its effect on linked
              neutral variation. In the restrictive case when there is no
              recombination, all linked variation is removed. If recombination
              is present but rare, both deterministic and stochastic models of
              positive selection show that linked variation hitchhikes to
              either low or high frequencies. While the frequency distribution
              of variation can be influenced by a number of evolutionary
              processes, an excess of derived variants at high frequency is a
              unique pattern produced by hitchhiking (derived refers to the
              nonancestral state as determined from an outgroup). We adopt a
              statistic, H, to measure an excess of high compared to
              intermediate frequency variants. Only a few high-frequency
              variants are needed to detect hitchhiking since not many are
              expected under neutrality. This is of particular utility in
              regions of low recombination where there is not much variation
              and in regions of normal or high recombination, where the
              hitchhiking effect can be limited to a small (<1 kb) region.
              Application of the H test to published surveys of Drosophila
              variation reveals an excess of high frequency variants that are
              likely to have been influenced by positive selection.",

              hence are not destined for rapid elimination from the population
              by selection. Approximate formulas are derived for the reduction
              below classical neutral values resulting from such background
              selection against deleterious mutations, for the mean times to
              fixation and loss of new mutations, nucleotide site diversity,

              approximation to the dynamics of quantitative traits, based on an
              analogy with statistical mechanics. We present a modified version
              of that approach, which makes the analogy more precise and
              applies quite generally to describe the evolution of allele
              frequencies. We calculate explicitly how the macroscopic
              quantities (i.e., quantities that depend on the quantitative
              trait) depend on evolutionary forces, in a way that is
              independent of the microscopic details. We first show that the
              stationary distribution of allele frequencies under drift,
              selection, and mutation maximizes a certain measure of entropy,
              subject to constraints on the expectation of observable
              quantities. We then approximate the dynamical changes in these
              expectations, assuming that the distribution of allele
              frequencies always maximizes entropy, conditional on the expected
              values. When applied to directional selection on an additive
              trait, this gives a very good approximation to the evolution of
              the trait mean and the genetic variance, when the number of
              mutations per generation is sufficiently high (4Nmicro > 1). We
              show how the method can be modified for small mutation rates

              three confirmed cases of recent adaptation resulted in soft
              selective sweeps and where there is evidence that the effective

  title    = "Stability and response of polygenic traits to stabilizing
              selection and mutation",
  author   = "de Vladar, Harold P and Barton, Nick",
  abstract = "When polygenic traits are under stabilizing selection, many
              different combinations of alleles allow close adaptation to the
              optimum. If alleles have equal effects, all combinations that
              result in the same deviation from the optimum are equivalent.
              Furthermore, the genetic variance that is maintained by
              mutation-selection balance is [Formula: see text] per locus,
              where $\mu$ is the mutation rate and S the strength of
              stabilizing selection. In reality, alleles vary in their effects,
              making the fitness landscape asymmetric and complicating analysis
              of the equilibria. We show that that the resulting genetic
              variance depends on the fraction of alleles near fixation, which
              contribute by [Formula: see text], and on the total mutational
              effects of alleles that are at intermediate frequency. The
              interplay between stabilizing selection and mutation leads to a
              sharp transition: alleles with effects smaller than a threshold
              value of [Formula: see text] remain polymorphic, whereas those
              with larger effects are fixed. The genetic load in equilibrium is
              less than for traits of equal effects, and the fitness equilibria
              are more similar. We find that if the optimum is displaced,
              alleles with effects close to the threshold value sweep first,
              and their rate of increase is bounded by [Formula: see text]
              Long-term response leads in general to well-adapted traits,
              unlike the case of equal effects that often end up at a
              suboptimal fitness peak. However, the particular peaks to which
              the populations converge are extremely sensitive to the initial
              states and to the speed of the shift of the optimum trait value.",

  author   = "Jain, Kavita and Stephan, Wolfgang",
  abstract = "We consider an infinitely large population under stabilizing
              selection and mutation in which the allelic effects determining a
              polygenic trait vary between loci. We obtain analytical
              expressions for the stationary genetic variance as a function of
              the distribution of effects, mutation rate, and selection
              coefficient. We also study the dynamics of the allele
              frequencies, focusing on short-term evolution of the phenotypic
              mean as it approaches the optimum after an environmental change.
              We find that when most effects are small, the genetic variance
              does not change appreciably during adaptation, and the time until
              the phenotypic mean reaches the optimum is short if the number of
              loci is large. However, when most effects are large, the change
              of the variance during the adaptive process cannot be neglected.
              In this case, the short-term dynamics may be described by those
              of a few loci of large effect. Our results may be used to
              understand polygenic selection driving rapid adaptation.",

               the latter situation, in which the extremes hare a low fitness

  title    = "Properties and modeling of {GWAS} when complex disease risk is
              due to non-complementing, deleterious mutations in genes of large
              effect",
  author   = "Thornton, Kevin R and Foran, Andrew J and Long, Anthony D",
  abstract = "Current genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have high power to
              detect intermediate frequency SNPs making modest contributions to
              complex disease, but they are underpowered to detect rare alleles
              of large effect (RALE). This has led to speculation that the bulk
              of variation for most complex diseases is due to RALE. One
              concern with existing models of RALE is that they do not make
              explicit assumptions about the evolution of a phenotype and its
              molecular basis. Rather, much of the existing literature relies
              on arbitrary mapping of phenotypes onto genotypes obtained either
              from standard population-genetic simulation tools or from
              non-genetic models. We introduce a novel simulation of a
              100-kilobase gene region, based on the standard definition of a
              gene, in which mutations are unconditionally deleterious, are
              continuously arising, have partially recessive and
              non-complementing effects on phenotype (analogous to what is
              widely observed for most Mendelian disorders), and are
              interspersed with neutral markers that can be genotyped. Genes
              evolving according to this model exhibit a characteristic GWAS
              signature consisting of an excess of marginally significant
              markers. Existing tests for an excess burden of rare alleles in
              cases have low power while a simple new statistic has high power
              to identify disease genes evolving under our model. The structure
              of linkage disequilibrium between causative mutations and
              significantly associated markers under our model differs
              fundamentally from that seen when rare causative markers are
              assumed to be neutral. Rather than tagging single haplotypes
              bearing a large number of rare causative alleles, we find that
              significant SNPs in a GWAS tend to tag single causative mutations
              of small effect relative to other mutations in the same gene. Our
              results emphasize the importance of evaluating the power to
              detect associations under models that are genetically and
              evolutionarily motivated.",
